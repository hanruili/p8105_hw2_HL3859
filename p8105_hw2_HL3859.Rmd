# Problem 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

nyc = 
  read_csv("NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

nyc_clean = 
  nyc |>
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, 
         entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))

nyc_clean
```

The dataset contains `line` which shows 36 subway lines. `station_name` represents the names of the station. `station_latitude` and `station_longitude` represent the coordinates of the station. `route1` to `route11` show the subway routes served by the station, there are 11 routes. `entry` indicates whether entrance is allowed (TRUE/FALSE). `vending` indicates whether there is a vending machine (YES/NO). `entrance_type` is the type of entrance (e.g. `r unique(nyc_clean$entrance_type)`). `ada` inndicates whether the station is compliant with ADA standards (TRUE/FALSE).
